# The Oracle Bot
This is a discord bot developed for the Jak Month discord by Quartz563.
## Basic purpose and functionality
The primary purpose of this bot is to provide administrative assistance to the various moderators and administrators of the discord, alongside providing support to the organiser members of the discord by acting as an online catalogue of content that the participants of the event would submit.
